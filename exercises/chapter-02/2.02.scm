; Consider the problem of representing line segments in a plane. Each segment
; is represented as a pair of points: a starting point and an ending point.
; Define a constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and end-segment
; that define the representation of segments in terms of points. Furthermore, a
; point can be represented as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y
; coordinate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and selectors
; x-point and y-point that define this representation. Finally, using your
; selectors and constructors, define a procedure midpoint-segment that takes a
; line segment as argument and returns its midpoint
