; Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square-list procedure of Exercise
; 2.21 so that it evolves an iterative process: 

(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons (square (car things))
                    answer))))
  (iter items '()))

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))

; Unfortunately, defining square-list this way produces the answer list in the
; reverse order of the one desired. Why?
;
; Answer: because Louis is iterating the list starting from (cdr things) which
; is the last value and moving its way to the first value

; Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the arguments to cons: 

(define (square-list items)
  (define (iter things answer)
    (if (null? things)
        answer
        (iter (cdr things)
              (cons answer
                    (square
                     (car things))))))
  (iter items '()))

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))

; This doesnâ€™t work either. Explain.
;
; Answer: in the second procedure, Mr. Reasoner is storing in the first element
; of the pair a list and a number in the second element.
