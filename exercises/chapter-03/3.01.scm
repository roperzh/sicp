; An accumulator is a procedure that is called repeatedly with a single numeric
; argument and accumulates its arguments into a sum. Each time it is called, it
; returns the currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure make-accumulator
; that generates accumulators, each maintaining an independent sum. The input
; to make-accumulator should specify the initial value of the sum

(define (make-accumulator sum)
  (lambda (amount)
    (set! sum (+ sum amount))
    sum))

(define A (make-accumulator 5))

(= (A 10) 15)
(= (A 10) 25)
