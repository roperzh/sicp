; Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing Exercise 1.24. His
; fast-prime? test seems to run more slowly than his prime? test. Louis calls
; his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis’s code, they
; find that he has rewritten the expmod procedure to use an explicit
; multiplication, rather than calling square:

(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder
          (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
             (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
          m))
        (else
         (remainder
          (* base
             (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
          m))))

; “I don’t see what difference that could make,” says Louis. “I do.” says Eva.
; “By writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the Θ ( log ⁡ n )
; process into a Θ ( n ) process.” Explain.

; Answer: Louis is calling `expmod` twice as much for each even number,
; effectively making the number of steps proportional to `n`
