; Let f and g be two one-argument functions. The composition f after g is
; defined to be the function x ↦ f (g(x)) . Define a procedure compose
; that implements composition. For example, if inc is a procedure that adds 1
; to its argument:
;
; ((compose square inc) 6)
; ; Value 49

(define (compose f g)
  (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define (inc x) (+ x 1))

((compose square inc) 6)
